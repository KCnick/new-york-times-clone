This is a clone project of the page of a New York Times article done using HTML with a major focus on Semantics HTML and also CSS with emphasis on the box model, float, and positioning. It is a collaborative project as part of the HTML and CSS (Technical) Curriculum of Microverse. This is the branch we mostly worked on before merging.
